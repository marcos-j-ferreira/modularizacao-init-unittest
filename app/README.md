# \_\_init\_\_.py

A common file used in larger Python projects to manage packages and ensure proper module structure and behavior.

## What is `__init__.py`?

> _Note:_ The `__init__.py` file is used to indicate that a directory is a Python package. It allows you to initialize package-level variables, import submodules, and control what is exposed when the package is imported. It plays a crucial role in the organization and structure of larger projects.

### Purpose

> _Note:_ In large-scale applications, `__init__.py` helps manage the visibility and behavior of modules within a package. It can be used to simplify imports, initialize settings, or expose only specific functions or classes.

### Example Structure

> _Note:_ Here's a basic example of how it fits into a modular project:

```

my\_project/
├── app/
│   ├── **init**.py      # Marks this directory as a package
│   ├── module\_a.py
│   └── module\_b.py
├── main.py
└── README.md

```
